## üõµ What is does

[Middy](https://middy.js.org/) is a very simple middleware engine that allows you to simplify your AWS Lambda code when using Node.js. This middleware aims to simplify the implementations of a idempotent API.

Making an API idempotent is [not trivial as much people think](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/develop/utilities/idempotency/), and you could take a look at _Lambda Powertools for Python_ from AWS that does a great job to explain this use case and a concrete way to implement. There's also this great article from [Malcolm Featonby](https://twitter.com/mfeatonby), [Making retries safe with idempotent APIs](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/) featured in the Amazon Builder's Library as [Architecture level 300](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/category/learning-levels/advanced-300/) which falls ins the _advanced_ classification.

## üöÄ Install

Use your favorite package manager:

```bash
yarn add middy-idempotent
```

```bash
npm install middy-idempotent -S
```

## Usage

Besides `@middy/core`, you must also use `@middy/http-json-body-parser` since this middleware will read the request body and needed parsed as json. And right now I only tested twith the client provided by the `ioredis` lib as well, so you'll need to install it too. At tthe bottom there's a write-up where we'll find how to use a Serverless Database service called [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) for free that is currently (`0.0.20`) the only storage supported.

```ts
handler.use(jsonBodyParser()).use(
  idempotent({
    client: new Redis(process.env.UPSTASH_REDISS),
  })
);
```

Just place in your code, as soon as possible, passing the Redis client constructor with your `rediss://` url. See `demo` for an example of application with infrastructure provisioned in AWS CD
Besides the client, you have th possibility to choose your own idempotency key instead of the whole `event`:

| Prop   |      Type      |  Description |
|----------|:--------:|------------|
| **client** |  Instance of class Redis | instance of the class Redis provided by the lib [`ioredis`](https://github.com/luin/ioredis), the only supported at the moment |
| body |    boolean or string   | Optional. If `true` uses the body sent in the request. If no body is sent, this will yield an error.  |
| header | string | Optional. If you pass any value, will try to get this value as a key header in your request (i.e, `x-forwarded-for` and `x-idempotency-key`) |
| path | String. One of "rawPath" or "rawQueryString" | Optional. If you want to target a very specific (and possibly dynamic) path or raw query string in the request |
| ttl | number | Optional. Redis keys live forever by default, so being able to set a time to live is useful to avoid running out of memory in your Redis instance, as this will cause your lambdas to fail. Time unit: _seconds_.

Note that the optional targets are mutually excludents, they obey the hierarchy `body` > `header` > `path` meaning if you pass all of them, it will pick `body` and if that is not provided `header` is picked. The default behaviour is use all the event object as idempotency key.

### TODO
- [ ] Add more storages (DynamoDB, etc)
